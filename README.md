# Instructions to compile and run the project

### First of all clone the git repository
***

## Compilation
1. Enter in the folder that contain Counter.Java
2. Open in the terminal
3. Type the following command line: 
    
    _javac Counter.java_

Everything will works well and you could execute

## Running 
1. Type the following command line any arguments you want:

    _java Counter arg arg_
2. For example: 

    -_java Counter 9 16 2_

    -_java Counter -p 9 -b 16 -i 2_

    * Spaces are importants
    * If you type 2 or 3 arguments, you have to follow this order : base, position, iteration. Obviously, in this case, you can enter only 2 arguments as base and position.
    * You are free to add options like -i, -p, -b respectively as iterator, position and base.
        
        * If you choose this case, to avoid any confusion, you have to specify options for each arguments.
    
    * Once again, it's obvious that you can only enter base and position options witch are required. Also, it's not a problem if you swap the options.
